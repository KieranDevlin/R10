# R10 üë®‚Äçüè´

R10 is a hybrid, native application for both IOS and Android. It is a speaker session scheduling app where the user can favourite different sessions, and find the sessions with the Google Maps API. It uses [React-Natives](https://reactnative.dev/) built in components and the [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) library for stack navigation throughout the app.

## Installation Instructions

Follow the instructions below to run the application in on your local device.

### Installation

```
yarn install
```

### Run IOS

```
react-native run-ios
```

### Run Android

```
react-native run-android
```

## Technologies Used

### GraphQL / Apollo Client

- A more direct query language to access data in an API
- Integrated queries with Apollo Client and RED Academy's endpoints

### React-Native

- A component based JavaScript library that uses state management to create complex User Interfaces for both IOS and Android OS.

- Uses super simple, built in components like `View Text Image SafeAreaView` for quick and easy app builds

## Personal Learnings

I learned the advantages of using Node.js, and open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment, to build a full-stack app. Being able to use JavaScript on both the front and back-end has plenty of advantages, most importantly for me, using one language for multiple purposes. It also uses Googles V8 JavaScript engine to compile code, making implementing code faster and easier than ever. Node.js also has a huge, supportive, and active community that is alwasy working towards improving Node.js itself

The benefits of using GraphQL to access data via an API vs REST are clear, and its popularity is rising. With an eloquent schema, queries can easily and quickly avoid over/under fetching data, making client queries very efficient.

Express.js is an excellent framework for building a web application quickly and efficiently.

PostgreSQL can easily be created, altered, or otherwise manipulated with both Terminal using the command `psql` or using a GUI like [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) or [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/).

React quickly became the go-to JavaScript library for building apps, and for good reason. The state management, component based ecapsulation, and quick integration with most technology stacks makes it a very approachable and appealing library. Although state-management and hooks are very new to me personally, the idea of controlling components based on data being pass through components, or via context, is exciting.

Material UI has great components and the quick implementation made building this app a breeze. The documentation is well written and comprehensive.

This app had quite a learning curve, especially the client authentication. Hashing and encryption are exciting topics, but very complex. I am excited to see what apps I will get the opportunity to make next!
